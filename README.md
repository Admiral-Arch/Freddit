# Freddit
A project to free Reddit.


Roadmap:

  find way to grab main text(DONE)
  Find way to grab name of Op
  Find way to grab pfp of OP
  Match pfp to name in custom object probably
  Find way to get replies
  Do all the stuff we did with OP to replies(probably will have to somehow automate finding the HTML tags for replies)
  In case it requests a captcha be able to detect the captcha and forward it to user
  Map reply chains
  Make search work(somehow)
  Figure out how to host this using HTTP
  Make reddit links redirect to the host
